## Making a plan

HTML
Need three paragraphs of information
with a start quiz button
and a span to display the result

JS
need to set variables for the quiz button
and space for the results to display using getElementById
add an event listener to the button
    console log, or set an alert to test it's working
// import functions and grab DOM elements
//add an event listener to our quiz button to kick off the quiz upon Click
  // track the local state by declaring a variable and setting it to zero 
  // ask for first and last name, then ask if they want to continue the quiz
    // if they input No (or anything that doesn't start with a `y') the quiz will stop
    //if the user inputs a string beginning with a 'y' the quiz will begin  
    // if the countsAsYes formula validates the input as true (starting with a Y), increase the value of correctResults by one
need to alert the user the quiz is over - and to check the page for displayed results
if the results are 100% we will display ~pretty message, and a 'try again' if the user didn't get all answers correct
