## Making a plan

HTML
Need three paragraphs of information
with a start quiz button
and a span to display the result

JS
need to set variables for the quiz button
and space for the results to display using getElementById
add an event listener to the button
    console log, or set an alert to test it's working
within the event listener we declare the name of the input, and ask our question using the prompt function
we need to track the results in a variable, and increase the count if the input is a correct answer
